ðŸ¤– AI Development Notice:
This software was built with AI assistance using Claude (Anthropic) in a collaborative
"vibe coding" session. The development process involved iterative refinement,
real-time problem solving, and comprehensive feature implementation guided by
AI assistance while maintaining high code quality and Go best practices.

The AI contributed to:
- Architecture design and implementation patterns
- Protocol compliance and specification adherence
- Security feature development and best practices
- Comprehensive testing and example creation
- Documentation and code organization

This represents a new paradigm in software development where human creativity
and AI capabilities combine to create robust, production-ready software.
